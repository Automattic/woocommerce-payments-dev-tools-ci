# woocommerce-payments-dev-tools

A suite of tools helpful when developing WooCommerce Payments.

## How to use

- Download this repo as a ZIP and install it as a plugin on your site.
- From the [Code tab](https://github.com/Automattic/woocommerce-payments-dev-tools), click on the Code button to expose a dropdown. This will open a small drop down menu. Select `Download ZIP` from that menu and save it somewhere convenient.
- Navigate to wp-admin on your test site and then `Plugins` > `Add New`. Upload the ZIP you downloaded in the previous step. Activate the plugin after upload completes.
- After activating the plugin, you should have a new top level menu item `WCPay Dev` on your wp-admin sidebar (all the way at the bottom). Click on it.
- For general use (e.g. creating a test account), only the `Dev mode enabled` checkbox and `Display notice about dev settings` should be checked. Make sure everything else is unchecked. If you have to make changes, be sure to click `Submit` to apply them.
